## The Plazes.net website and API service are ceasing operation as of August 15, 2008 ##

**With the [acquisition of Plazes by Nokia now complete](http://blog.plazes.com/?p=253) the Plazes development team is concentrating its resources building something new within Nokia, and it's very likely that the structure of the Plazes API will change significantly.**

### As such, the Plazes.net website and the Plazes.net API will cease operation on August 15, 2008. ###

**The Plazes.com site, and [the Plazes.com API](http://plazes.com/api/docs), will remain in operation for the time-being.**

## Introduction ##

The [Flickr documentation for machine tag format](http://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875), aka "triple tags," a mechanism for enhanced tagging designed primarily for machine-readable applications.

Machine tags can be used with Plazes in two ways:

  1. To tag Plazes themselves so as to enhance the meta-data available about the Plaze. For example, a Plaze can be tagged **tel:office=+19028922556** to add its telephone number.

> 2. To tag objects from ''elsewhere'' so as to connect them with a Plaze, a Plazes user or a Plazes presence.  For example, a Flickr photo can be tagged **plazes:id=87873** to indicate that it's a photo of a Plaze with id of 87873.
