## The Plazes.net website and API service are ceasing operation as of August 15, 2008 ##

**With the [acquisition of Plazes by Nokia now complete](http://blog.plazes.com/?p=253) the Plazes development team is concentrating its resources building something new within Nokia, and it's very likely that the structure of the Plazes API will change significantly.**

### As such, the Plazes.net website and the Plazes.net API will cease operation on August 15, 2008. ###

**The Plazes.com site, and [the Plazes.com API](http://plazes.com/api/docs), will remain in operation for the time-being.**

Plazes is a geopresence service with a rich API that affords the ability to build applications and mashups that are "geo-aware."

Plazes consists of a consumer web application, [Plazes.com](http://plazes.com), and a developer-focused geopresence engine, [Plazes.net](http://plazes.net).

This project is a home for open source code that uses the Plazes API, as well as a place for developers to document applications, obtain sample code, and obtain answers to questions.

If you would like to contribute to this project -- to use it to host code, to contribute to the wiki, etc. -- just send an email to [plazes.advocate@gmail.com](mailto:plazes.advocate@gmail.com).
