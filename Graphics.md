## The Plazes.net website and API service are ceasing operation as of August 15, 2008 ##

**With the [acquisition of Plazes by Nokia now complete](http://blog.plazes.com/?p=253) the Plazes development team is concentrating its resources building something new within Nokia, and it's very likely that the structure of the Plazes API will change significantly.**

**The Plazes.com site, and [the Plazes.com API](http://plazes.com/api/docs), will remain in operation for the time-being.**
