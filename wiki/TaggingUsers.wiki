#summary Proposal for tagging other objects with Plaze users.

== Introduction ==

MachineTags can be used to add meta-data to web objects (Flickr photos, Upcoming events, etc.).  This page describes a proposed method for tagging objects with Plaze user IDs to relate them to specific Plazes users.

== Details ==

Every Plazes user has a unique ID.

Using the _plazes_ namespace, we can thus create a machine tag for that user in the form:

{{{
plazes:user_id=user_id
}}}

For example:

{{{
plazes:user_id=1185
}}}

would relate the given object to [http://plazes.com/users/1185 this Plazes user].
