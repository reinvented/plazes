#summary Specifications and proposals for using machine tags for Plazes

== Introduction ==

The [http://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875 Flickr documentation for machine tag format], aka "triple tags," a mechanism for enhanced tagging designed primarily for machine-readable applications.

Machine tags can be used with Plazes in two ways:

 1. To tag Plazes themselves so as to enhance the meta-data available about the Plaze. For example, a Plaze can be tagged *tel:office=+19028922556* to add its telephone number.

 2. To tag objects from ''elsewhere'' so as to connect them with a Plaze, a Plazes user or a Plazes presence.  For example, a Flickr photo can be tagged *plazes:id=87873* to indicate that it's a photo of a Plaze with id of 87873.
