#summary Proposal for tagging Plazes with Internet availability information.

= Introduction =

MachineTags can be used to add meta-data to individual Plazes.  This pages describes a proposed method for tagging Plazes with information about the availability of Internet access.

= Details =

The Plazes data model contains one boolean field, _has_free_wifi_, that records network access.  I propose we expand this with machine tagging to include general Internet network access, wifi, using the machine tag pattern:

{{{
internet:medium=access
}}}

Where:

*medium* is one of wifi, ethernet, kiosk and ...?

*access* is one of free, charge, freewithpurchase, freeforguests and ...?

For example:

{{{
internet:wifi=free
internet:ethernet=charge
internet:kiosk=freeforguests
}}}
