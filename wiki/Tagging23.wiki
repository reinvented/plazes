#summary Proposal for tagging Plazes with 23 photos

== Introduction ==

MachineTags can be used to add meta-data to individual Plazes.  This page describes a proposed method for tagging Plazes with [http://www.23hq.com/ 23] photo IDs, to allow a Plaze to be connected to photos of itself.

This mechanism is identical to that proposed for TaggingFlickr.

== Details ==

Every 23 photo has a unique *photo_id*.  

Passing this ID to the 23 API method [http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getInfo.html flickr.photos.getInfo] retrieves information about the photo, including enough information to construct URLs that lead to the photo.  As such, all we need to tag is the photo_id.

Because the Flickr machine tag specification doesn't allow namespaces to start with characters other than a-z, it's proposed that the namespace _photo23_ be used rather than _23_.

For example:

{{{
photo23:photo_id=2973409
}}}

would relate the given Plaze to [http://www.23hq.com/reinvented/photo/2973409 this 23 photo].
