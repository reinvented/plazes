#summary Proposal for tagging Plazes with telephone numbers.

= Introduction =

MachineTags can be used to add meta-data to individual Plazes.  This pages describes a proposed method for tagging Plazes with telephone number information.

= Details =

The [http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard#adr_tel_email_types hCard specification] outlines a set of telephone number types.  It's proposed that we use these types to using the following machine tag format:

{{{
tel:type=value
}}}

For example:

{{{
tel:work=+19028922556
}}}

This would be equivalent to the hCard construct:

{{{
<div class="tel">
   <span class="type">Work</span> +19028922556
</div>
}}}
