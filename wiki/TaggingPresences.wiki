#summary Proposal for tagging other objects with Plaze geopresences.

== Introduction ==

MachineTags can be used to add meta-data to web objects (Flickr photos, Upcoming events, etc.).  This page describes a proposed method for tagging objects with Plaze geopresence IDs to relate them to specific Plazes presences.

== Details ==

Every Plazes presence has a unique ID.

Using the _plazes_ namespace, we can thus create a machine tag for that presence in the form:

{{{
plazes:presence_id=presence_id
}}}

For example:

{{{
plazes:presence_id=6129470
}}}

would relate the given object to [http://plazes.com/activities/6129470 this Plazes presence].
