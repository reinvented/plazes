#summary How to identify the MAC address of the network gateway for various OSes.

= Introduction =

One of the easiest ways of identifying the "current Plaze" is to use the MAC address of the network gateway, passing it to the API as a [NetworkIdentifiers network identifier].

The MAC address of the network is available in a variety of ways, which tend to vary according to operating system, and even within OS flavours.  This page is an attempt to document these methods.

== Mac OS X ==

{{{
#!/bin/bash

ARP="/usr/sbin/arp"
NETSTAT="/usr/sbin/netstat"
GREP="/usr/bin/grep"
SED="/usr/bin/sed"
CUT="/usr/bin/cut"

# Get the default gateway's IP address.
GATEWAY=`$NETSTAT -rn | $GREP default | $CUT -c20-35`

# Get the MAC address of the default gateway.
MACADDRESS=`$ARP -n $GATEWAY | cut -f4 -d' '`

# Pad the single-hex parts of the MAC address with leading zero
# i.e. 0:4:5a:fd:83:f9 becomes 00:04:5a:fd:83:f9
MACADDRESS_CONVERTED=`echo $MACADDRESS | \
$SED "s/^\(.\):/0\1:/" | \
$SED "s/:\(.\):/:0\1:/g" | \
$SED "s/:\(.\):/:0\1:/g" | \
$SED "s/:\(.\)$/:0\1/"`
