## Description ##

iPlazer is a web-based application targeted at the iPhone and iPod Touch.

From the [About](http://iplazer.com/#_about) page:

> This is a simple tool, designed for the iPhone and iPod Touch, that makes creating new activities at Plazes.com much easier. You need to already have a Plazes account to use iPlazer. Once you've logged in with your username and password, enter the name of the Plaze you're at (or a substring) and your status message and touch Create Activity. You'll then be shown a list of matching Plazes: just touch the correct one, and your activity will be created. From there you can continue to update your status message at the same location, or click New Location to start a brand new activity. The current version does not allow new Plazes to be created.
